# Stop the Wizard

This project started off as a small personal venture aimed at honing my programming skills while diving into the world of software development. It's a text-based adventure game playable in your browser. Although it's still in its infancy, with many planned features yet to be added, the groundwork has been laid. The game generates random events, challenging players to either fight or find a way to escape. I'm still iterating through ideas, trying out new features and improving the game overall.
