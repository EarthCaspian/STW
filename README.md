# STW

This is a small project I thought of and prepared to progress in general programming, encounter problems, and practice. It is a browser based text-adventure game. The game is still at the very beginning and many features I have thought of have not yet been added. Currently, there are 5 zones, 4 enemies, and 5 conditions in the game, and events are generated randomly to fight or escape from them. In the future, I am thinking of adding a real story to the game, more detailed interactions, graphics and/or sound.
